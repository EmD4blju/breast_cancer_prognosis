# Breast Cancer Prognosis

## 1. Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare various machine learning models to determine which is best suited for predicting whether a patient is affected by breast cancer. The study aims to identify the most effective model for this use case, rather than simply building a single classifier.  

Key components of this analysis include:  
- **Data Pre-processing**: Ensuring the dataset is clean, normalized, and prepared for modeling.  
- **Data Visualization**: Exploring the dataset through visual methods to better understand feature distributions, correlations, and class separations.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing and comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms.  

The findings will offer insights into the suitability of various models for this critical medical application, emphasizing accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.
